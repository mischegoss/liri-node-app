# liri-node-app
###This is the homework for Week 10 of Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp.
In this assignment, I made a LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

### Dependencies 
Node-Spotify-API, Axios, Inquirer, FS, Moment, DotEnv. The node app draws data from  OMDB API and the Bands In Town API.

## This is a command line app

A video of the working app in action can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/NGXfx7wt2as)
